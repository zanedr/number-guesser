#### Number Guesser©!

Welcome to Number Guesser©! The 1993 Chevy Malibu of number guessing games!
Similair to Chevy's flagship vehicle, it comes with no features beyond what you
see at first glance. 

Please see our extensive troubleshooting section should problems arise.

Years of intensive research and a budget reaching in the billions of dollars have
made it possible for you, the user, to enjoy the childlike glee of guessing numbers
with virtually no prior experience.

Upon startup, the dashboard will be populated by four buttons (Set new range, 
Guess, Clear, and Reset) and three input spaces (Minimum: 1, Maximum: 100,
and Pick a number).

First time users will want to focus on the 'Pick a number' input. We strongly
suggest you do what it says. As soon as you enter a number the buttons labelled
Guess and Clear will become available for use. If you're unsure of your guess,
try Clear. If you're comfortable with the number, hit Guess.

The guess button will inform you whether the number you chose was too high,
too low, or just right. If your guess was outside of the simple rules Number
Guesser© laid out, an alert box will bluntly inform you of such. Number guessing
is serious business and we don't sugar coat this shit.

Upon a correct guess, Number Guesser© will congratulate you, and kick the difficulty
up by widening the range of numbers. Expert users can use the Minimum and Maximum
input boxes to customize their number guessing experience.

And if at any time you feel it's time to start over, our handy Reset™ button can
make your dreams come true.

From all of us at the Number Guesser© team, guess away!
